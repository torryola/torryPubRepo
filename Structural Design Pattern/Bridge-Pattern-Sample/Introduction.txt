Bridge Pattern 


When to use it: 
1. When you want to decouple between abstraction and its implementation 
2. When both the abstractions and their implementation should be extensible 
3. When client's code should not have to be recomplied due to the changes to the implementation of an abstraction
4. When you to hide the implementation of an abstraction for clients completely

Note ==>> This pattern can get complicated easily
