        ************ Proxy Design Pattern *****************
 Proxy design pattern is like an intermediary between the client and object(s). Call it a Middle-man


 Advantages:
 - It controls access to the resources by the client
 - It hides the possibly complex implementation from clients

 Disadvantage:
 - It can lead to too many extra classes being created if not controlled, complex code to manage as a result.
