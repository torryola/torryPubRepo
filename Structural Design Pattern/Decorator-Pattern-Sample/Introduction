        Decorator Design Pattern

This pattern allow you to attach additional functionality to objects at dynamically.
it is a strict principle of open for extension closed for modification
Decorator provide alternative to sub-classing(i.e Inheritance) for extending functionality

Advantages
- Functionality can be added to an object dynamically without affecting existing functionalities
- More flexible than static inheritance

Drawback
- Lead to too many small classes which is an added complexity

For brevity, decorator is about how you compose objects to create a new functionality

In this demo, we are going to create menu dynamically based
e.g. BronzeMember will have fewer menu options than SilverMember
