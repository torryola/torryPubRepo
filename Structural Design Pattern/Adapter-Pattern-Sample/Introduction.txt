Apater Pattern 

Is one of the Structural Design Pattern approaches. It helps the developer be able to implement unrelated or seperate classes/objects
via composition. 
E.g. 
1. Plug-Adapter that enables American plugs to work in the British 3-pin sockets 
2. MediaPlayer that plays different media file formats
