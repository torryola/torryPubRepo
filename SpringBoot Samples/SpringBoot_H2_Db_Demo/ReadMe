In this tutorial, we are going to focus on Spring Boot and H2 Database.
Spring Boot gives developers flexibility to quickly run an application using in-memory database h2 to emulate the
production database connection with the application.

Advantage:
- it is faster
- Promotes RAD
- It is Free.
- Testing is easy because the developers can easily perform CRUD operations with simple data
- It is safe in a way, as the developer doesn't need to interact with the live Db;
Disadvantage:
- It is in-memory hence is volatile

NOTE ==>>
1. sa is the default username set by spring boot for H2 in-memory DB, as root is default to MySql
2. The in-memory can be changed to persist the data in the file e.g. 	jdbc:h2:[file:][<path>]<databaseName>
for more other modes http://www.h2database.com/html/features.html#connection_modes

Using the previous example with little tweak
Tasks:
- Create database in h2
- Create properties for the database connection
- Perform CRUD ops on the newly created database
- Test :  reuse the existing controller to test the changes

****** Run Below command in terminal **************
mvn clean compile
mvn spring-boot:run

NOTE ==>> The rest of the previous example will remain same

basic CRUD operations in Spring Boot.
Create : Adding objects to Collection
Read : Outputting the collection content
Update : Changing 1 or 2 values in a Collection
Delete : Removing item from Collection

For this brevity, Map will be used to emulate Database-like functions

Sample Data Format on Postman

{
    "userId" : "user4@email.com",
    "feedTitle" : "Azure",
    "feedContent" : "Azure Infrastructure Fundamental Core Services"
}

{
    "userId" : "user1@email.com",
    "feedTitle":"Spring Boot",
    "feedContent":"CRUD Ops in Spring Boot"
}
