In this tutorial, we are going to focus on basic CRUD operations in Spring Boot.
Create : Adding objects to Collection
Read : Outputting the collection content
Update : Changing 1 or 2 values in a Collection
Delete : Removing item from Collection

For this brevity, Map will be used to emulate Database-like functions

Sample Data Format on Postman

    "feedTitle":"Spring Boot",
    "feedContent":"CRUD Ops in Spring Boot",
    "feedDateTime":"2020-08-23T16:49:52.995"
}

{
    "id" : 10,
    "feedTitle" : "GCP",
    "feedContent" : "GCP Infrastructure Fundamental Core Services",
    "feedDateTime" : "2020-08-23T15:04:52.995"
