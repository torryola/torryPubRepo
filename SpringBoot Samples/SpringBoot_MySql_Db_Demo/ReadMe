This tutorial is a step-up from the previous Spring-Boot With H2 Db demo, focusing on Spring Boot with MySql Database.

Summarily, replacing H2 database with MySql database

NOTE ==>> For this to work, you should create Database in in MySql first as Table cannot exists without the Db.

Using the previous example with little tweak
Tasks:
- Create database and Table in MySql using the commands in main/resources/createDb.sql and sampleData.sql
- Create properties for the database connection
- Perform CRUD ops on the newly created database
- Test :  reuse the existing controller to test the changes

****** Run Below command in terminal **************
mvn clean compile
mvn spring-boot:run

NOTE ==>> The rest of the previous example will remain same

basic CRUD operations in Spring Boot.
Create : Adding new data to table
Read : Outputting the records in the table
************** Exercise **********************
Update : Changing 1 or 2 records in the table
Delete : Removing a record from the table
************ End of Exercise ********************

Sample Data Format if using Postman

{
    "userId" : "user4@email.com",
    "feedTitle" : "Azure",
    "feedContent" : "Azure Infrastructure Fundamental Core Services"
}

{
    "userId" : "user1@email.com",
    "feedTitle":"Spring Boot",
    "feedContent":"CRUD Ops in Spring Boot"
}
